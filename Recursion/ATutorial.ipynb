    "### What is Recursion?\n",
    "Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller subproblems of the same type until the problem becomes simple enough to solve directly. Recursion is widely used in programming, mathematics, and problem-solving techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, recursion defines a sequence or function by expressing its terms or values in terms of other terms or values in the same sequence or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts of Recursion\n",
    "- Base Case:\n",
    "    - This is the simplest case of the problem, which can be solved without further recursion. Without a base case, recursion would continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.\n",
    "- Recursive Case:\n",
    "    - This is where the function calls itself to break the problem into smaller parts."
